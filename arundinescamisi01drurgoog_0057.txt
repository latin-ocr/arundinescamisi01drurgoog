annuemus caut.

It ie to goze. upon' her eyes
With eager joy and fond surprize,
Yet temper'd with such ohaete and awful tear,
Aa wretchee feel who wait their doom;
Nor must one ,ruder thought preeume,
Thongh but in whispere hreathed, to meet her ear.

It is to hope, though hope were lost,

Though heaven and eanth thy wishes oroee’d: ³,
Though she were bright ae sainted queens above, Ι

And thou the least and meanest swain ⁴

That folda his floek upon the plain, y

ξ Yet if thou dareet not hope, thou dost not love. „

y

lt ie to qneneh thy joy in teare, ι
To nurse strange thoughts and groundless fears: ;
3 If pange of jealousy thou hest not proved, '¹
’ Thongh she were fonder and more true
Than any nymph hld poete drew,

h 0 never dream again that thou haet loved.

If, when the derling maid ie gone,
Thou dost not seek to he alone,

, Rapt in a pleeeing tranoe ostender voe:
And muse and sold thy languid arms,

¹, Feeding thy fancy on her cherma,

Ι Thon dost not love-for love is nourish'd eo.
