Ann the world's n stage,

And ull the men and women merely playere3

ἶ And then the whining school-buy with his satohel ἶ
ἒ ⁹ And shining morning face, oreeping like snuil
Ἰ Unwillingly to school. And then the lover

Sighing like iurnaoe, witha woful bullad
3 Made to his mistrees' eyebrow, Then a soldier 1

Ι In fair round belly with good capon lined,
Ξ With eyes severe, ond benrd of formul eut,
} Full oi wise saws and modern instanoes3
ἶ And eo he plays his part. The sirdh age shifts ] ¹

ἦ With speetuulee on noue und pouoh on side;
’ His youthful hose well saved, a world too wide

'2 For hio shrunk shnnk, und his big munly voice
