EVENING.

ΗΑιι meek eyed maiden, clad in sober gwy,
Whose soh approach the weary woodman loves,

As homeward bent to kiss his prattling babes, ’
Joound he whistles through the twilight groves.

When Phoebus siuks behind the gilded hills,
You hightly 0'er the misty meadows walk3
The drooping daisies bathe in honey (lewe,
And nurse the nodding violet's tendet atah. Ἴ

The panting Dryade that in day's fierce heah .
To inmost bowers and oooling caverns ran,

Retum to] trip in wauton evening dhuce3
Ι Old Silvan too returns, and hughing Pan.

To the deep wood the clamorous rooks tepuit,
Light skims the swallow 0'er the watery scene;

And from the sheepcote and fresh h1rrowed held ’
, Stout ploughmen meet, to wrestle on the green.

ἶ The swain, that artless sings on yonder ronk,

χ κ His supping sheep and lengthening shadow spies3 p'
1 Pleased with the 0001, the calm, refreshfih hour, ι

2 And with boam hamming of unnumbered flies. ξ
