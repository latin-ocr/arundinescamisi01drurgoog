DEATH.

Αι, but tn die, and 3ο we know not where;
Το lie in eold obstruction, end to rot:
This sensible wnrm motion to become
A kneeded elod; and the delighted spirit
ι To bathe in fiery ssoede, or to reside
ἶ ΙΙιι thrilling regions of thick· ribbed 10e3
To be imprisonffld ιιι the viewless winde,
ἱ And blown with resiless violence round about
ι The pendent world; or to be worse then worst ·
¹, 0f those, that lawless end uncertain thoughts
, Imagine howling—'tis teo horrible!
· The weariest and most loathed worldly life
Ξ 'Phae age, aehe, penury‚ and imprisonment .
Oen lny on nature, is a paradise
ι To what we sear of death.

² NOTHING OAN GOME OF NOTHING. i

Tnnnn was an old women called‘ Nothing ιιι-311
, Who rejoiced' ιιι a dwelling exeeedingly smalh Ι
3 A men sinet tehed his mouth to its u tmost extent,
Ϊ And down et one gulp house and old woman went.
