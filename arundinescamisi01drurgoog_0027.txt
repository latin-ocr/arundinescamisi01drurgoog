A SIXPENNY SONG.

Sme a song os eixpence
A pocket full of rye:
Four and twenty bleekbirds
Beked in a pie.
When the pie was opened‚
The birds began to eing;
Wae not that e deinty dish
Το eet before the King?

The King was in the parlour
Oounting out hie money;
The Queen was in the kitehen
Eeting breed end honey;
The Meid was in the guden
Hanging out the clothes3

Down came e bleekbird

And perehed upon her noee.

Gema Guneou. ¹

' INSORIPTION ΟΝ AN ANTIQUE RING. '

Ιίι heare thy voice of melodie
¹ In whispers of the summene eir;
I'll see the brightnesse of thine eye
· In the blue eveninge's ehininge etexre3
In moonlighte beemee thy uritie;
And look on heavenne, te {ok on thee!
Oeom.
