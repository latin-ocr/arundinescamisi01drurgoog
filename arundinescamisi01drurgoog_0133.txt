OENONE.

ς Ο Monnnn Ide, many-sountnined Ida,
Dear mother Ida, heerhen ere I dio.
Alolt the mountain lewn was dewy dnrk
And dewy dnrk aloft the mountain pino;
Beantifnl Pario, evil-hearted Paris,
Leoding ejet-blook goat, white-homed, whitehooved‚ ¹
(lame up srom re'edy Simois all alone. .

0 mother lde, heerken ere Ι die.
γ Ι sate alone: the golden-sandnlled morn
Boeo-huod the soomful hille: l sate alone Ι
With downompt eyes: white-breested like a star ἰ
Fronting the dnwn he came: a leopard skin
From hio white shoulder drooped: his sunny heir
Oluotered ebout hie templos like a god's: , .
, And his oheek brightened, astho loom-bow brightens l
When the wind blows the loom: end I called out- ,
l ‘Weloome Apollo, weleome home Apollo,
, Apollo, my Apollo, loved Apollo'.

Deer mother Idn, heerken ere Ι die.
He, mildy smiling, in his milk-white palm
close-held a golden epple, lightning bright

With changefnl flasheS, dropt with (lew of heaven l
ἑ Ambrosielly smelling. From his lip, p ¹
, Ourved erimoon, the full-flowing river os speech

,Ι Oame down upon my heort.
