TOM BOWLING.

Hnnn s sheer hulk lies poor Tom Bowling‚
The derling of our orew3

No more he'll hear the tempest howhng,

For Death has brooohed him to.
} His form was of the msnliest beauty,
His beart was kind and soft;

Faithful below he did his duty,
But now he's gone aloft.

ἵ Tom never from his word deportem
ἵ 'His virtues were so rare3
1 His friends were many aud truehearted3
ς mfflmfflmm
, And then he'd sing so blithe and jolly
Ι Full many a time and oft;
r But mirth is turned to mehuoholy‚
For Tom is gone alost. η

Yet moy poor Tom find pleasant westher
’ When He, who all commende,

1 shall give, to coll life's orew together,
J The word to pipe nl hands!
3 Thus Deoth‚ who kings mid tsrs despatches,
In vain Tom's life hos doffed;
For though his body’s under hatohes
His soul has gone alost.

Durum.
