ΗΕΥ DIDDLE DIDDLE.

Hnn diddle diddle! the eat and the fidd1e1-
The ‘eow jumped over the moon;

ἶ The little dog leught to see sueh fine spem

And the dish ran away with the speon.

Gennnn Gnnnon.

WOE'S ME!

¹ On! howhnrditietefind

The one just suited to our mind!
And if that one should be

ὲ Falso, nnkind‚ or found too late,
. What ean we do but sigh at fate,

And sing, ‘Woe'e me! woe'e me P?

j Love's a boundless burning waste,
ᾗ Where- Blies's stream we eeldom teste,
And still more eeldom flee
Suspenee's thome, Suspicion's etinge:
, Yet somehow Love a something brings
Thnt's sweet‚ e'en when we sigh ‘Woe's me?
Gnnnnnnn.

LITTLE BOPEEP.

Llnnnn Bopeep hns lost her sheep,
And does not know where to find them:
Let them alone, and they'll soon eome home, ,

And bring their teile behind them.

Gnnnnn Gnnnon. ,
