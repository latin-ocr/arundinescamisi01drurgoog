' ¹ nar nom ne muung emus ignoble sture,
'l'heii sober wishes never learned to strcy;
Along the cool sequestered vale ol lile
They kept the noiseless tenour ol their way.

ι Yet e'en these hones from insult to protect,
Some lrail memorial still erected nigh,
With uncouth rhymes aud shapeless sculpture declred,
Implores the passing tribute ol a sigh.

Their name, their years, spelt by th' unlettered Muse
⁴ The place oi fame aud elegy supply:

And many a holy text around she screws
ἶ Thai teach the rustic moralist to die.

For who, to dumb Forgetfulness a prey‚
This pleasing anxious being e'er resigned,
l nee the Μ praenes or ue onaan day,
¹ Nor cast one longing‚ lingering look behindl

, On some fond breast the parting soul relies,
Some picus drops the closing eye requires;
. E'en l'rom the lomb the voice ol Nature eries, ’

E'en in our ashes live their wonled lires.

For thee, who, mindiul of th' unhonoured dead,
Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;
l Ii chauces hy lonely Contemplatiou led,
l Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy late,
