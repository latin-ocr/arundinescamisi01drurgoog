¹ MAD TOM.

I AM mad Tem, behold me!

My senses are gone from me;
l'm mad, I'm sure,
I'm past all cure,

And Bedlam searee een hold me.

l'll elimb yon lolty mountain,
, And there I'll fight the gypsies;
I'll play st bowls
With the sun and moon,
And beai them both to eclipses.

l'm wiser than Apollo;
For while he lay a sleeping‚
Ι saw the stare
At morial jars, .
While Vulean was a weeping.
