Oonn follow, follow me,
You feery elvee that be,
Whioh oirole on the green,
, Oome follow Mnb your queen:
’ ’ Hand in hand let's donee emund,

For this place is Feery ground.

When mortale ore et rest,

And snoring in their nest,
Unheard and unespied

Through keyholes we do glide;
Over tebles stools ond ehelves

We trip it with our Foery elveS.

Upon a mushroom bed
Our table eloth we spreed;

A grain of rye or wheat 1
Is manohet which we eat3 .

Peorly drops of (lew we drinlr
In aeorn oups filled to the brink.

The braine of nightingales‚
With unctuous fet of sutile,
Between two oookles stewed‚
Is meet thnt's easily ehewed:

Tnils of worrne ond marrow of unice,
Do melre a dish thnt'e wondrous nice.
