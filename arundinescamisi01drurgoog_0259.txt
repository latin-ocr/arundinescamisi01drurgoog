MOUNT SAIN'P BERNARD.

' Wnnnn these rude rocks on Bemard's summit nod,
Onoe heavenwnrds sprung the throne of Pennino Jove,
An ancient shnine of hospitnble Love,
¹ Now turns the altar to the Christian's God.
Hete pesoefnl Piety‚ nge on nge, has trod .
The waste; still keeps her vig'ls, takes her rest; ,
Still ns of yore salutes the coming guest, ’
And oheers the wem-y ns they onward rove,
Henling each wayworn limb-or oft will start
catehing the stonn-lost wanderer's sinlsing cry,
Speed the rioh eordinl to his ebbing beart,
Ohnfe his stiff limbo and bid him not to die.
So tnsked to smooth stem Winter's drifting wing‚

And gnrb the etemnl snows in more etemal spring.
