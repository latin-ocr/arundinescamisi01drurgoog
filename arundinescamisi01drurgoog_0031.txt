SANDY'S GHOST.

Τ1111 Moon 111111 olimbed the highest hill
Whioh rises o'er the source 01 Dee,
And from the eastern summit 011011
Her silvery light o'er tower ond tree;

When Mmy nid her down to sleop,
Her thoughts on Sendy fer at see,

When low end soit u voioe she 11011111
Say-‘ Mory, weep 110 111010 101 me?

She from her pillow gently raised
Her head, to see who there might be;
She saw young Sondy shivering stand,
With visege pnlo 111111 hollow e'e.

‘0 Meiden deor, oold is my oley,
‘It lies beneoth a stormy see; ·
‘Fur 1111 from thee 1 sleep in 11011111,

‘So, Mmy,—weep no more for mo.

ι0 Moiden deor, thyself prepare,
‘We soon shall meet upon that shore
‘Where love is free from doubt und oure,
‘And we sholl meet to pert no more?

houd crowed the oooh3 1110 Shadow ssoh
No more of Sondy oould she see;
But soft the parting Spirit suid—

‘Sweet Mmy, weep no more 101 me?
Ouo Brutus.
