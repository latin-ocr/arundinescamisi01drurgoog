THE KNIGHT'S GRAVE.

‚ Wnnnn is the grave of Sir Arthur O'Kellyn '
Where may the greve of thet good men be?
By the side of e fount on the breest of Helvellyn,
n Under the twigs os e young bireh tree.

The onk that in summer wne pleasant to hear,
And russsed ite leaves at the seu of the year,

And bellowed end whistled in winter alone,
Is gone-in its place the birch tree is grown. ,
The knight's bones are dunt,
And his good sworff rust-
His soul is with the sainte l trust!

Gonnnmen.
