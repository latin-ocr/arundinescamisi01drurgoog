THE SHRUBBERY.

Os! happy shrdes—to me unhlest!
Frlendly to peace, hut not to me!

How ill the soene that offers rest,
And hesrts that cannot rest, agree!

This glsssy stream, that spresding pino,
Thoso olders quivering to the breem,
Mighl soothe a soul loss hurt than mine,
And plesse, if anything could plesse.

Bul fixed unaltersble care
Forgoes nol what she leels within,
Shews the same ssdness every where,
And slights the sesson and the soene.

For ell that plessed in wood or lawn,

While peaes possessed those silent bowers3
Her animaling smile withdraw,

Has lost its heauties and its powers.

The saint or morallst shordd troad
This mess grown olley musing‚ slow;

They seek like me the secret shsde‚
But not like me to nourish woel

Me fruitfd soenes and prospeets waste
Alike admonish not to r0am;
These tell me ol enjoyments past,
And those of sorrows yet to come. Ι
