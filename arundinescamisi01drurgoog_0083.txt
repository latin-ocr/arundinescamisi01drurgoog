THE HIeH-METTLED RAOER.

l Sne the eouree thronged with genere: the sporta are begnn:
The confusion but hear! ‘l'll bet you, Sir'-‘ done‚' ‘done Γ
Ten thousand strange elemours resound far end neor3
Lorne, hnwkere‚ ond jookiee esseil the tired ear!

y While with neck like a rainbow, ereeting his erest,

' Pampered‚praneing‚endpleased‚hie nose touohinghisbreast‚ ³

ἶ Sooroely enuffing the air, he'e so proud end elate,

ὲ The high-mettled Rooer storto first lor the plate.

l Now Reynnnd'e turned out, and o'er hedge and ditch rnsh ’
l Hounds‚ horses, end hnntemen, ell hard athis brush3

1 They run himet length, end they have him at bay,

l And by noent end by view cheat a long tedious way;

y While alike born for sponte of the field and the course,

³ Alwaye sure to oome through, a etnuneh ond lleet horse,

When fairly run down the fox yields up his breath‚
ἑ The high-mettled Reeer ie in at the death.

Grown aged, vneed up‚end turned out ol the stud,
’ ¹ Lame, spavined, and wind-golled but yet with some blood, .
ἵ While knowing poetilions his pedigree troee,
Tell hie dam won thet sweepetakee, hie sire gained thie rece,
,χ And what matohee he won too the ostlers oount o'er‚
³ As they loiter their time at some hedge· -alehouse door; Ι
⁵ While the harnees sore galle and the epure his sides good, l
l The high· -mettled Reeere a haoh ont the rond.
