nummus essii.

AT A FUNERAL.

Brverrrr our ieet and o'er our heed '
Ie equel werning given,

Beneeth ue lie the enuntiem dead,
Above us ie tire heaven!

Their nemee ere greven on the stone,
Their bones are in the clay,

And ere another dey is done,
Oureelvee mey be ee they.

Deeth rides on every passing breem,
He iurke in every flower‚

Eeeh eeaeon hee ite own dieeaee,
Ite peril every hour.

Our eyee have seen the very light
Οἱ youth'e eeft eheek deeey,
And seve deeeend in sudden night

On menhood'e middle dey.

Our eyes have seen the steps of ege
Helt feebly towards the bamb,

And yet shall earth eur heerte engege
And dreeme οἰ days to eomei

Turn, mortel, turn! thy danger know;
Where'er thy foot een treed,

The earth rings hollow from below,
And warne thee οἰ her dead.
