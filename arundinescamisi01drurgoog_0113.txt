THE MEETING OF THE SHIPS.

. Wnnn 0'er the silent sees alone
Ξ For days and nights we've eheerless gone,

ξ Oh those who've felt it, know how sweet

Some eunny mom a sail to meet!

÷ Sparkling et once is every eye,

‘i ‘Ship ehoy! ship ahoy!' our joyful ery;
And answering beck the sounds we hear,
j ‘ship ahoy! ship ahoy! what ehem, what eheerr

¹ Then sails are bachae, we neerer eome3
, Kind words ere said of friends and home—

Τ111 soon, too soon, we part with pain,
Το sail o'er silent sees again.
Momm.
