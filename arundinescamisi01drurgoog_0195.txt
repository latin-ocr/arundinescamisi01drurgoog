FIDELE'S GRAVE.

„Wnn inirent honere,
' wint summer ints, aad 1 nve nem, rnen,
I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack ’
The flownr, that's like thy iane, pale primrose; nor
The azure harebell, like thy veins; no, nor
The leaf of eghntine, which not 1ο eineder,
ψ Oet-sweetened not thy brenth: the ruddoek would,
1 With ehariteble bill (Ο bill, sore shaming
Those rich left heire, thet let their fathers lie
t Without a monument !) bring thee 1111 this;
Yen, and furred mose beside, when flowers are none,
To winter-ground thy corse.
