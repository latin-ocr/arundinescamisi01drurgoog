Tuon hidot me come away,
And 1³11 no longer stay, ·

For inulto oi former years,
And to repent some crimes
Donc in thc present timcs3
Το don my robes of love
Fit for the place abovc3
= Το gird my loino about
With chority throughout:
And so to hovcl hence
With icet of inncccncc.
This donc, I'll only cry
“God mercy!”-cnd so die.

Bonnncn a slccping infant licc—

Το earth hio body lent,
t Heroni cnr mor'e gimnus ose,

Ano when the arch-angeio trump shall hlow,
And souh to bodico join‚
Thousands will wish their lives below,
Hcd been no short cs thine.
