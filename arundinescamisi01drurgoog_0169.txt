ἶ Tne enrfew ιοΙΙο the knell of parting day,

The lowing herd winds elowly o'er the lea,
1 The ploughman homeward plods his weary wey,
ξ And leaves the world ιο darlmess and ιο me.

ζ Now fades ne gnmmenng nnnnpe on the sign,
i nne ιο ne an a solemn sennen h01n‚'

' Save where the beetle wheels his dmning flight,

' nnn nowsy tnnngs nn ne disent fons:

ξ Save that, from yonder ivy-mnntled towen
: 'Phe moping owl does to the Moon comphin
0f such ae, wandering near her secret bower,
Molest her ancient solitary reign.

ι ι Beneath those mgged elme, that yew-tree's shede,¹ ,
J Where heaven the turf in many ο monldering heap, ι

’- ἰ Εοοιι in his narrow cell for ever laid,
f The rude forefethers of the hnmlet sleep.

ξ The breezy call of ineense-breathing Moru,

i The swanow witering from the snm-bnt ned, j

1 The eoch's shrill ehrion, or the eehoing horn,
χ Νο more shall rouse them frhm their lowly bed.

For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,
Or busy housewife ply her evening care:
’ Νο children run ιο lisp their sire's return,
Or climb his knees the envied kiss ιο share.
