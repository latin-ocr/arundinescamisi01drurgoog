THE PLEDGE.

Dmmt to me only with thino eyes,
And I will pledge with mine3
01· leave a kiss within the cup,
And l'll not ask sor wine.
The thirst, that from the soul doth spn'ng‚
Doth ask a draught divine3 ἒ
But might 1 from Jove's nectar sip, . '
l'd change it not for thine.

THE MARKS OF LOVE.

Coun here, fond* youth, whoe'er thou be,
That boast'st to love as well as me,
And if thy breast have felt so wide a wound,
⁵ Oome hither‚ and thy flame approve;
ΙἯ teaoh thee what it is to love,
And by what marks true passion may be found.

Itistobeallbathedintears,
Το live upon a smile for years,

To lie whole ages at a beauty's feet,
To kneel‚ to languish to implore,
And still, though she disdain, adore. .
‚lt is to do all this, and think·thy sufferings sweet. Ι
