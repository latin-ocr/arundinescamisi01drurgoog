The inseot youth are on the wing,
Eoger to toste the honied spring,
And lloot umid the liquid uoon: =
Some lightly o'er the current ohim,
Some show their guily-gilded trim
Quiok glunoing to the sun.

'l'o Contemplatiou's sober eye
Suoh is the rece of man:
And they that oreep‚ ond they that fly,
Shull eud where they began.
Alihe the busy oud the gay
But llutter through lile'e little day,
In fortuue'e varying colours duest:
Brushed by the hund os rough Misohanoe‚

Or ohilled by age, their airy denoe
They leave, in (lust to rest.

Methinke 1 hear in accentu low
The sportive kind reply-

’ poor morano! and what art uon?

A solituuy flyl
Thy joys no glittering female meets,

s No hive host thou ol boarded eweete

ΝΑ painted plumuge to display:
On hasty wings thy youth is flown;

Ϊ Thy sun is eet, thy spring is gone-

We lrolio while 'tis May.
