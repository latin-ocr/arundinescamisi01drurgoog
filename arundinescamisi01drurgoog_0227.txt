HARP OF THE NORTH.

Hune ol the North, larewell! The hille grow (burk,

On purple peaks e deeper shade deseending;
ln twilight eopse the glow-worm lighte her sperk3
The deer hell-seen are to the eovert wending.
Resume thy wimd elm! the loumtein lenling,
And the wild breero, thy wilder minstrelsy5
Thy numbers sweet with nature's vespere blenrling,
With distant eeho irom the sold and lea,
And herdboy's evening pipe end hum ol housing bee.

Yet onoe again larewell‚ thou minstrel Harp!
Yet onoe egein forgive my leeble sway;

And little reok Ι ol the censure sharp

¹ May idly eavil et an idle lay.

Mueh heve 1 owed thy strains on life's long way,
Through secret woee the world has never known,

When on the weary night dnwned wearier day,
And bitterer was the gnei devoured alone.

Thet I 0'erlive such woes, Enohnntress, is thine own!
