1 · The unwearied suu from day ιο day
’ Doee hie Creator's praise display,
And publiehee ιο every laud
The work of an Almighty hund.

Soon ae the evening shudes prevaih

The moon takes up the woudroue tale, '
And nightly ιο the listening earth
Repeats the story ο1“ her birth—

While 1111 the sture that round her bum‚'
And 1111 ι11ο planete iu their turn,
Ooufirm the tidingu os they roll,

And spread the truth from pole ιο pole.

What though in solemn silence 1111

Move round the durh terrestrial boll,
What though nor voice nor minstrel sound
Among their rudiunt orbs be found—

With saints and angele they rejoioe,
And uhter forth a glorious voice,
For ever singing as they' shine,
“The hand that made us is divine.''
