t But Knowledge to their eyes her ample pege,

Rich with the spoils ol time, did ne'erunr0113

(lhill Penury repressed their noble ruge,
And lroze the genial current ol the soul.

¹ Full many egem ol purest ray serene,

The derk unlsthomed caves of ocean beer:
ᾖ Full many a {lower is born to blnsh nnseen‚
And waste its sweetness on the desert eir.

Some villageHempden that with deuntless breast
'l'he little tyrant of his lields withstood;
i Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,

: Some Oromwell gniltless ol his eountry's blood.

u Th' applause ol listeuing senates to command,
’ The threets ot' puin end ruin to despise
To soatter plenty o'er a smiling land,

ἰ And read their history in a nation's eyes,

  Their lot lorbad: nor circumscribed alone

’ 3¹ Their growing virtues, but their crimes eontined;

. Forbed to wede through sleughter to a throne,
i And shut the gates ot' meroy on mankind3

t The struggling penge of conseious truth to hide,
' To quenoh the blushes ol ingenuous eliens,
Or heap the shrine ol Luxury enti Pride

With incense hindled at the Muse's fleme.
