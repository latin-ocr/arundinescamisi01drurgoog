Pnornnw of flod, arise and take

With thee the words· of wrath divine,
'l'he scourge of heaven, to shnke
O'er yon aposiate shrine.

Where angela down the luoid stair
Come hovering to our sainted sires,
Now in the twilight glore
The heathen's wimrd fires.

(ἕο, with thy voice the altar rend;

Scatter the ashes3 be the arm,
That idola would befriend,
Shrunk at thy withering oharm3

Thon turn thee, for thy time is short,

But traoe not 0'er the former way,

Lest idol pleasures court
Thy heedless soul astroy.

Thou know'st how hard to hurty by,
Where on the lonely woodland road
Beneath the moonlight sky
The festo] warblings flowed3

Where maidens to the Queen of Heaven
Wove the gay danae round oak or palm,
Or brenthed their vows at even
In hymns as soft as balm.
