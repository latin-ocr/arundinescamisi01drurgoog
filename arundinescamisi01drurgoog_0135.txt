. ‘My own OEnone

:' Benutiful-browed OEnone‚ mine own eoul,

j Behold this fruit, whose gleaming rind engrnven

4 “For the most feir''‚ in astertimes moy breed

¹ Deep evil-willedness 01 heaven and sere
Heorthurning toward hollowed Ilion;

1 And all the oolour 01 my nster-life

j Will be the shadow 01 todey. Todny

Here end Pallas and the floeting grace
' 01 leughter-loving Aphrodite meet

In many-folded Ida to receive
¹ This meed os bennty, she to whom my hand
Ι Award the palm. Within the green hill-side,
Under yon whispering tuft 01 oldest pine,
’ Is an in-going grette, strawn with‘ spor
And ivymatted nt the mouth, wherein
Thou unbeholden mayet behold, unhenrd
' Heer all, and see thy Paris judge 01 gods?

Trnnreon.

HUMPTY DUMPTY„

’ Honnrn Donnrr sat on a wall;

Humpty Dumpty had a great fall:
Not ell the King's horees, nor ahl the Queen's men,

‚ Oould put Humpty Dumpty on the wall again.
