PRAYER 1⁴¹0ss ABSOLUTION.

Fon every sentence, clause, and word,
That’s not inlaid wiih thee, 0 Lord,
⁸ Forgive me, God! and blot each line

Out of my book, that is not thine- .
But if midet ell thou findest one
Wanting thy benedieti0n‚
That one of all the rest shall be
¹ · The glory of my work and me.
