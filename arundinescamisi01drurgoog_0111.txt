Pqun.

I uuvn found Peene in the bright earth,
And in the sunny sky3

By the low voiee of summer sene,
And where streone murmur by.

Ι find it in the quiet tone
of voices that I love;

By the fliekering of e twilight fixe, “
And in a leefless grove:

1 find it in the silent flow
of eolitnry thought,

In calm half-meditated dream,
And reueoninge eelf taught.

But eeldom heve I found such Pence,
As in the eoul's deep joy

Of penning onward, free from herm,
Throngh every dny's employ.

If geme we eeek, we only tire,
And list our hopes too high: Ι

The constent flowers that line our way
Alone oen eetisfy.

Aunoun.

THE GRENADIER.

Wuo eomes here!-A grenndier.
What d'ye wana-A potos beer.
Where's your money 2-1 forgot.
oet you gone, you drunken sot!
