‘Suu will you please to walk beforel'
‘No pray, Sir, you are next the door τ’
‘Upon my honour, I'll not stir'-
‘Sir‚ l'm at homa-consider, Sirl'
‘Exouue me Sir, I'll not go first?
‘Well if Ι must bo rude, Ι must-
But yet Ι wiah Ι oould evade it;
'Tio strangely olownish—be persuaded?
(ἕο forward cito-go lorward squires; ¹
Nor scruple each what aaoh admiras.
Life squar-es not friends with your prooeediug‚
⁴ lt flios while you display your braeding:
Such braeding as one's granium preaohes‚ Ι
’ Or some old danoing master taaohoa
ι O lor some rude tumultuoua follow,
⁴ Hali orazy, or at least half mellow‚
To coma behind you unawares
χ And fairly lick you both down stairo!
' out, naua at uno-ret me arose γε,

Go lorward friends, or he'll surprise ye.
