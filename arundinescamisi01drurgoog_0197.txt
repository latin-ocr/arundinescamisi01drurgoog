ΤΟ CERES.

: Orare, most bounteous lady, thy rich lees
Of wheat, rye, berley, vetehes, oete end pease;
'l’hy turiy mountains, where live nibbiing sheep,
And flet meeds thstched with stover, them ὼ keep: γ
Thy bank with pionied and twilled brime,
Which spungy April et ὼγ hest betrims,

· Το make eold nymphe eheste erowns; end thy broom
groves,

Whose shsdow the dismissed baebelor loves,
Being lesslorm thy pole clipt vineysrd3
And ὼγ sea-merge sterile end roeky-hsrd,
Where thou thyseli dost sir—the queen 0' the sky,
Whose watery ereh, end messenger em Ι,
Bide thee leave these; ‚end with her sovereign grsee,
Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
To come end sport: her peeeoelrs fly amein3
Approeeh, rich Oetes, herto entertain.
