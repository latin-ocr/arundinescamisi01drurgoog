⁴⁴ For who would trust the seeming si'ghs

0f wife or paramour?
Fresh feres will dry the bright blue eyes
We late saw streaming o'er.

For pleasures past I do not ghiwe,
Nor perils guthering nean

My greatest grief is that I.leave
No thing that claims n tear.

“And now l'm in the world alone,
Upon the wide, wide sea:

But why should Ι sor others groan,
When none will sigh sor me?

Perchance my dog will whine in vain,
vTill sed by stranger hands;

But long ere Ι come back again
He'd tear me *where 'he stands.

‘⁶ With thee, my harh, I'll swihly go
Athwart the foaming brine; ’

Nor care what land thou bnar'st me to,
So not again to mine.

Welcome‚ welcome‚ ye dark blue waves!
‘And when you fail my sight,

Welcome‚ ye desertn, and ye caves!
My native Laud-Gom] Night !'' κ
