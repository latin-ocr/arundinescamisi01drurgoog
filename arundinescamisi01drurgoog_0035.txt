ΓΙ) ΒΕ Α BUTTERFLY.

ζ I'n be a Butterfly born in a bower,
i Where roses and lilies and violets meet;
⁴ Roving for ever from flower to flower,
And hissing all huds that are pretty and sweet! ÷

Γᾶ never hnguish for wealth or for power;
γ Γᾶ never sigh to see slaves at my feet:
Γᾶ be a Butterfly born in a bower‚

Kissing all buds that are pretty nnd sweet.

0 could 1 infer the wana osa tany,
’ Γᾶ have a pair of those beautiful wings:
Their summer-day's ramble is spontive and airy,
They sleep in a rose when the nightingnle sings. ᾗ

. Those‚ who have wealth‚ must be watchful and wary3 ξ
, Power, alas! nought but misery bn‘ngs!
Γᾶ be a Butterfly sportive and airy,
Rock'd in a rose when the nightingale sings! Α

What, though you tell me each gay little rover ’
¹Shrinhs from the breeth of the first autumn day! j,
Sure it is better, when summer is over, ’
To die when all fair things are feding away,
‚Some in life's winter may toi] to discover
Means oi procuring a weary delay-
τ ni ne a Buten„ living a fover,
ς Dying when fair things are fading away!

Hnwwns annnr.
