Around from all the neighbouring streete
The wondering neighbours ran,

And swore the dog hed lost his wite,
To bite so good n men.

The wound it seemed both sore and sad
To every Christian eye;

And while they swore the dog wes med,
They swore the men would die.

But soon a wonder cameto light, ’
That shewed the rogues they lied;
The man recovered of the hite;
The dog it was that died.

THE TROPIO SUN.

Ann now, my raee of terror run,
Mine be the eve of tropio sun3
No pede gradatione quenoh his ray,

2 No twilight dews his wrath nilny3

- With dish like battleterget red,

He rushes to his burning bed;
Dyes the wide ware with bloody light;
Then sinks et once—and au is night.
