THE MAN IN THE WILDERNESS.

Two man in the wilderness asked me,

‘How many strawberries grow in the seo?

Ι onswered him, as Ι thought good,

‘As many as red herrings grow in the wood.'

EPISTLE TO Α FRIEND.

Wooo, be it so, my friend !-I've done
With mirth‚ extravagonoe and fun:

I sear I've passed the fatal line:

Thai uncheoked mirth and unstopped wine, Ι
That flow of wit that knows no bound, ἵ
The meny laugh's perpetual round,

Nay, e'en the sooial generous glow

That all-enlivening grapes bestow—

Joys that a few brief sennighte past

Ι thought etemelly would last,

Or fondly wished, before they fied,

I might be numbered with the dead-

No more are triched with oharms for me,
Nor wake my soul to jollity:

Thai is to pleasure I incline,

No more I view her form in wine,

Nor if bleah oore besets my soul,

Gan drown him in the sposkling bowl.
