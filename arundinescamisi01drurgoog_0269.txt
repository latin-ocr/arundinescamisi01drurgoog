ξ REOOVERY FROM SIOKNESS.

ἶ Ο ΒΑνιουιι of the faithsm deod,
With whom thy servante owen,
Though eold end green the turs ie spread,
Above their nemon oell;

No more we oling to montel oley,
We doubt ond seor no more,

Nor ehnnk to troad the darksome wey
Which thou hest nod before.

'Twee hond from those Ι loved to go,
Who knelt oround my bed,

Whose teors bedewed my buming bron,
whose arms upheld my head!

As rading from my dinzy eyes,
Ι sought their forme in vein, ι
The bitterness of doeth 1 knew,

And grooned to live again.

'Twns dreodfinl when the ooomer'opower
Aeooiled my oinking hem,

Reoounting every westenhem,
And each unworthy pert:

¹ But, Jeeus, in that montel frey, ·
Thy bleesod comfort stole,

Ι Like sunehine in a stormy day,
Aerossmy darkened soul.
