ΤΟ THE READER.

· Tm union of the soul and body here,
Which heaven hae ordered, cells for several treatment
To suit ite several parts—Our outwerd men
Aeks eheert‘ul exereiee3 our inwerd man
’ Must have his pauses too from serious thought,
And gathers vigour for his loftier flights
ᾗ By earthly relaxation-Yet my friend,
ἱ We must not hover here, nor skim the turf

Ι Unintermptedly, but imp our wings .

Α For rocks aen'al and for upper day.
