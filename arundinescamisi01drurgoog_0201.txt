Now every passion sleepe; desponding Leve,
And pining Envy, ever-restlees Pride;

A holy calm ereeps 0'er my peeeeful soul,
Anger and med Ambition's storme subside.

Omodeet Evening! ost let me appear Ι
Α wandering votary in thy pensive train3
Lietening to every wildly-warbling throet

Thet fille with harewell sweet thy derkening plain.

. Srrre e song of eixpenee
A pocket full of rye;
Four end twenty bleehhirds

Baked in a pie:
, When the pie was opened
The birds began to sing3
Wae not that a dainty dish
To set before the Kingt

The King was in the parlour
’ Oounting out his money;
The Queen was in the kitehen ·
Eeting breed end honey;
The maid was in the gerden
Hanging out the clothes:
Down came a blaehhird
And carried off her nese.
Grhhrn Guhrorr.
