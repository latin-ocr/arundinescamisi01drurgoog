ARETHUSA.

Ano now from their founteine
In Enne's mountains
Down one vele where the morning hoeke,
, Like friends onoe parted
Grown single-hearted,
They ply their watery teoke.
At sun-nise they leap
From their oradlee steep
In the curve of the shelving hili3
At noontide they flow
Through the woodo below,
And the meedows of Asphodel;
And et night they eleep
In the rooking deep,
Beneeth the Ortygien shore;
Like spirits that lie
In the eznre sky,
When they love but live no more.
Snnnnnn.

κ Howe'er from this time 1 shall ne er see your greces,
