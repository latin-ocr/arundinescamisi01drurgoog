“ ABUNDINES cnm.

mmor ro nrm noer smmi.

ln the hour of my dioneos,
When temptatione sore oppmm,
And when Ι my sine confece—
Sweet Spirit, comfort me!

When Ι lie within my bed,
Sick in beart and oick in head,

And with doubts discomfit'ed—
Sweet spirit, comfort me!

When the honcc doth sigh and wecp,
And the world is drowned in slcep,
Yet mine eyes their vigilo keep- ’

Sweet spirit, comfort me!

when 'tne'passing ben non ton,
And the furies in a shonl

Oomc to fright my parting seul-—
’ chet Spirit, comfort me!

When the tepere all burn blue, ἵ
When the comfortere are few,

And that number more thnn truc,-
Sweet Spirit‚ comfort me!

When the priest his last has prayed‚

And Ι nod to what is said,

'Oause my speech is now decayed-
Sweet Spirit, comfort me !
