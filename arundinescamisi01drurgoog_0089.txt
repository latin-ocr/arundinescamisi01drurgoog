OAROLINE.

I'm bid the hyacinth ιο blow,
I'll teach my grette green ιο be,
And sing my true love all below
The holly bower and myrtle tree.

There all his wild·wood sweete ιο bring,
The sweet south wind shall wender by,
And with the music of his wing

Delight my rusffing eenopy.

Come ιο my close and cluet'rmg bewer,
Thou spin't of e milder elene,

Fresh with the dews of fmit end flower,
And mountain heeth and moory thyme:

With all thy mrel echoee come, y
Sweet eomrede of the rosy Dey3

Wafting the wild bee's gentle hum,

And cuckoo'e pleintive roundelay. l

ι

Where'er thy morning breath hes pleyed
Whetever isles of Oceen immed,
Come ιο my blossemwoven abedo,
Thou wandering wind of seiry land.

For eure from some enehented isle,
Where Heeven and Love their sabbath hold, ᾧ
Where pure and happy spirite emile, '
Of beeuty's feireet brightest mould;
