HOME. ·

Β11111111111 the house of sacred rest,
Amid 11 thoughtless throng‚

At length I heard its ereed confessed,
' . ’ And knelt the saints among.

Artless his strain and unadomess
Who spoke Uhrist’s message there;
But what at home Ι might have scomed‚
Now chal-med my famished ear.

Lord, grant me this abiding graue,
Thy words and sons to kn0w;
To pierce the veil on Moses’ faoe,
Although his speech be 111011.

'Lm ᾸΡοετοιιοΑ.
