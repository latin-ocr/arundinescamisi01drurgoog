And bade it blossom there.

PSALM XXIII.
,Mr Shepherd is the living Lorii,
I therefore nothing need,
In pastores lair, near pleasant streams,
He sstteth meto leod.

He shall eonvert ond glad my soul,
And bring my mind in frome,

To walk in peths 01 righteousness,
For His most holy name.

Yes, though Iwalk the vale 01 Denth,
Yet will I fest no ill;

Thy rod and staff they comfort me,
And Thou art with me still.

And in the presence 01 my foss

My table 'l'hou hest spread,
Thon wilt fill full my cup, and Thou
Anointed hest my head.

'Ihrough all my life 'Ihy favour is
So lrankly shown tn me,

That in 'l'hy house for evermore
My dwelling plene shall be.
