Yon fly, invoke the gods; then turning stop i
To rail; ohe singing still whirls on her mop. ι
Nor yet the duet had ehnnned th' unequal etrite,

But, aided hythe wind, fought still for life.

t Now in eontiguoue dropo the flood comeo down, i

· Threatening with deluge this devoted town:

fi To shope in orowde the daggled femniee fly,

t Pretend to oheapen 'gooda but nothing buy.

J The templar spruoe‚ while every epout's abroaoh‚

Ξ While streame run down her oiled umbrella's sides.

L Here various kinds by various fortunas led,

⁵ Commendo acquaintance underneath a shed:

Triumphant tories and desponding whigs

ἵ Forget their fendo, and join to save their wige.

Boxed in a cheir the bean impatient site,
While sponte run elattering o'er the roof by fite; “

And ever and anon with frightful din
Ξ The leather sounds; he trembles from edthin.
Now from all parts the ewelling kennels flow,
i And bear their trophies with them ae they go:

OEstoeet they sailed from, by their sight and emell. i Ῐ
