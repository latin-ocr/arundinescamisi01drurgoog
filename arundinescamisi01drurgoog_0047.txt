Γ ‘My father bless'd me ferventfy‚ 1

Yet did not much eomplnim
But surely will my mother sigh
Till Ι come back again?—
α11101311, enough, my little lad!
Such team become thiae eye3
If 1 thy guilelme bosom had,

Mine own would not be dry.

“ Come hither‚ himer, my staunoh yeoman, · ι
Why dost thou looksopnlof ’
01· dost thou dread a French foemanf
Or shiver at the gudest-
‘Doem'st thou I tremble for my lifef
Sir Ohilde, l'm not so wealn
But thinking on an absent wife
Will blanoh a faithful cheek.

‘My sponse and boys dwell near thy hau,
Along the bordering lake,

And when they on their father call, ,
What answer shall she make?-

1 . “ Enough, enough, my yeoman good,

Thy grief let none gainsay3
Bu't I, who am of lighter moed,

Will laugh fo flee away.
