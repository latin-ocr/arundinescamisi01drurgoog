i THE DESERTED VILLAGE.

, How often hnve I ponsed on every chum,
The sheltered cot ond cultivated form,
The never-fniling hrook and busy mill,
. The decent chureh that topt the neighbouring hill,
l dishonoratus, wid aeas benoth ue suane, ,
y For talking nge and whispering lovers mode! l
gnowooennave1b1esne00mingny ’
ἶ when ton muling lent ns tum to puy,
l Anu an ne vinage eain from nbour free
l Led up their sports beneoth the spreoding tree;
l While many a pnstime oireled in the shade,
l The young eontending as the old surveyed;
ἵ And many a gamhol frolieked o'er the ground,
And slighls of ort and fests of strength went round;
And still as each repeated pleasure tired,
Sueoeediugsportsthemirthfubandinspired; l
’ The dnnoing pair thet simply sought renown ³
¹ By holding out to tire eaoh other down;
y The swain mistrnstless of his smutted faee,
y While seeret langhter tittered round the pleoe;
ξ The boshful virgin's sidelong looks of love,
i The matron's glanoe'thot would those looks reprove!
ἶ 'l'hese were thy charnis, sweet Villsge; sports like these
With sweet successioni taught even toil to pleose; l
These round thy howers their eheerful influenoe shed; ὲ
4 These were thy ohorms—but all these oharms are fled. l
