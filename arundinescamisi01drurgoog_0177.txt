Heply some honry-heoded swain may say,
‘0st have we seen him at the peep of down

Bmehing with hasty steps the dews away
To meet the eun upon the uplond lewn.

There at the (σοι of yonder noddiug beeoh‚
'l'hut wreathes its old fantastic roote so high,
His listless length ot noontide would he stretoh
And pore upon the brook thet bebbles by. '

Hard by yon wood, now emiling es in soorn, ι Ι
Muttering his wayward fancies he would reve, '
Now drooping woeful wan, like one sorlorn,
Or erezed with care-or orossed in hopeless love.

. One moro I missod him on the 'customed hill,
Along¹ the heoth ond near his favourite tree;
Another oame; nor yet beside the rill,

Nor up the lawn, nor ot the wood was he: ἓ

ἰ The next with dirges duo in sad array

ἶ Slow through the chureh-wey path we saw him borne.
d Approech and read (for thou const read) the hy,

l Graved on the etone beneeth yon aged thorn?

d Here rests his head upon the lap os Barth,
ἶ Α youth to fortune and to same unknown,
Feir Scienee frowned not on his humble biuh,

And Melanoholy marked him for her own.
