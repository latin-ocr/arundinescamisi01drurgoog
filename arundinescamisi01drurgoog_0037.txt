ARUNDINES cnm.

THE LOTOS EA'PERS.

Brrncnns they bore of thet enchnnted stem,
Laden with flower ond fruit, whereof they gave
’ ¹ To each: but whoeo did receive of them
· And teste, to him the guehing of the wave
Far fer away did seem to mourn end rave
On elien shoree; end if his follow epoho,
His voice wne thin, ae voices from the greve3
And deenenleep he acernen, yet all awnke;
And music in 'his eere his beoting heert did wake.
They sat them down upon the yellow nand,
Between the sun end moon, upon the shore3
And sweet it wne to drenrn of Fatherinnd,
And wife end child end slnve; but evermore
Meet weery eeemed the sen, weery the oar,
Weery the wandering fields of barren soem.
Then some one said, ‘We will return no more;'—
And ell at once they song, ιΟιιν island home
‘Ie fnr beyond the weve; vve will no longer roem?

Ae I was a going to sell my egge,

I met a men with bnndy legs,

Bnndy legs end crooked roes:-

I tripped up his bools, end he fell on his none.
