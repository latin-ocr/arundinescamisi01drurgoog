'Tio poet, 'tis poet-but l gree on it now
With oohing heert ond throbhing brow:

'Twas there ohe nureed me, ond there she died:
And memory llowe with e lave tide.

Sey it is lolly ond deem me weak‚

Whilet the eoolding drope roll down my oheelr3
But Ι love it, I love it, ond cannot tear

My eoul from my Mother's old Arm-(lhair.

sno ΤΗΑΤ trveo IN A siloe

Tereo was on old women who lived in a shoe;
· She hod so many children she did'nt know whht to do.

’ She gave them some broth without any breed,
’ Then whipt them all soundly ond sent them to bed.

BE WISE AND LIVE.

He who fights ond runs away
Will live to light another day:

But he who is in battle elain
(lan never hope to light again.
