THE OITY SHOWER.

. (innui observem may foretell the honr,
By sure prognostics‚ when to dread a shower.
While rain depende, the pensive oet gives 0'er
i Her frolics, and pursues her tail no more.
¹ Reiuming home at night, you'll find the sink
, strike your offended sense with double etink.

If you be wise, then go not far to dine3

You'll spend in conch hire more than save in wine..

A coming shower your shooting eorus presage3
y Old achas will throb‚ your hollow tooth will rage3 i
ι Saunoering in ooffeehouse is Duhnan seen3
i He damus the climate and complains of spleen. Ι
f Meanwhile the south, rising with ‹iabffled wings, ἐ ¹
A sable cloud athwart the welkin flinge,
ι That swill'd more liquor than it could nontam,

And, like a drunkasd, gives it up again.
i Brisk Susan whips her linen from the rope,
,ζ While the first drizzling shower is borne aslope:
1 Such is that sprinkling‚ which some careless quean ἰ·

, Flirts on you from her mop, but not so oleam
