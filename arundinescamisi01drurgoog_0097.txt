Thou, ὼγ tace, lie pale and low,
Pierced by shafts of many a bow3
And the falchion by ὼγ side

To ὼγ heart thy hand shall guide:
Orownless‚ bratheas, headloes, fall

‘Bss ba! hlack Sheep,
Have you any wool 2'-
‘Yes‚ master, that we have,
Two hage full: ·
One for our master,

And one for our dame,

But none for the naughty boy
That lives in the lane?

γ ΟΝ Lough Nea's bank astho fisherman strays

⁷ When the clear cold eve's deehning‚
3 He sees the round towers of other days
In the wave beneath him shining: ’

Thus will Memory often in dreams sublime
1 Gateh a glimpse of the days that are over; γ
¹ Thus, sighing, look through the waves of Time, '
For the long-faded glories they cover. ’
