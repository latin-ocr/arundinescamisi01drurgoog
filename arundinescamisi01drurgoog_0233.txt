ARUNDINES cnm.

MARY.

Mnnw, I believed thee true,

And Ι wne blest in thus believing;
But now Ι meum that e'er l knew

A girl eo loir end so deeeiving.
Fen hove ever loved like me-
Yen, 1 have lowed thee too sineerely!
’ And lew heve e'er deceived like thee:
Alae, deeeived me too severely!

Fere thee well !-yet think awhile

On one whose bosom bleede to doubt thee3
Who now would rather trust thet smile‚

And die with thee, than live without thee.
Fare thee well !-1'11 think ol thee:

⁵ Thou lenv'et me many a bitter token;

For see, dietmoting women, see-
My peoee is gone, my heart is broken!

Moonn.
