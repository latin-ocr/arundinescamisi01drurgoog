OFT IN THE STILLY NIGHT.

011 in the stilly night,
Ere elumber'e chain has bound me,
Fond Memory brings the light
Of other days around me.
The smiles, the hears, of boyhood's yeme,
The words of love then spoken; Ι
The eyes that ebone, now dimmed and gone;
The oheerful heerts now broken. '

Oh oft as I remember all
The friends thus linked together,

Whom 1 have seen around me fall
Like leaves in wintry weathen

1 feel like one who stands alone
In banquet hall deserted,

Whose lights are fled, whose garlands dead, '

And 1111 but he depagted!

Moooo. ’

’ ΒΑΒΥ BUNTING.

Β111 baby bunting ,
Father'e gone a hunting
Mother's gone a milking,
Sister's gone a silking,

Brother's gone to huy a skin
To wrap Baby Bunting in.
