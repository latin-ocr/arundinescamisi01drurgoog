JAOKY'S FIDDLE.

J Aen, come give me thy fiddle,
If ever thou mean to thrive.
Nay‚ I'll not give my fiddle
Το any man alive.

Π Ι should give my fiddle‚

They'll think that I'm gone mad3
For many a joyful day

My fiddle and I have had.

So live2 that sinking to thy last long sleop,

3 Smiles may be thiae, while all amund thee weep. l
