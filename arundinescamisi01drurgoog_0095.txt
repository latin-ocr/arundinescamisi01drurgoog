SAUL.

‘Tuon whose spell een raise the deod,
Bid the prophet's form appear?

‘Samueh rnise thy buried head! .
King‚ behold the phantom seer)

Ι Earth yowned: he stood the eentne of a cloud:
Light changed its hue reth-ing from his shroud: A
' nean stood an gnssy nnis fixed εγω
His hnnds were withered ond his veins were dry:
ἰ His foot in hony whiteness glittered there,
Shrunken and sinewless end ghostly bare: 3
From lips that moved not and nnbreathing frome, 2
, Like ceverned winde the hollow aooents eeme.
Saul seo, and fell to earth, as fello the oek
j At once, and blneted by the thunder stroke.

‘Why is my nleep disquieted3 ’
Who is he that calls the deod? ¹
Is it thou, Ο Κίηςέ-Βεὶιοίἀ
Bloodless ere these limbo and oold:
Suoh ere mine; and such shall be
Thine oo-morrow when with me.

Ere the coming day is done

Suoh shnlt thou be, such thy son.
Fare thee well! but sor a day3
Then we mix our mouldering clay.
