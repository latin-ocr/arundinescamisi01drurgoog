My oouniry's straino record
The triumph of her ohooen son,
The slaughters oi his eword3
The deeds he did, the fielde he won, ·
'she freedom he restored! 1
riough thou art fanen, while we ωε free, ²
Thou shalt not teste of death;
The generous blood that flows from thee
Diodeined to sink beneoth:
within our veine the current be,
Thy spirit on our breath!

EVENING HYMN.

Gon, that modest earth and heaven,
Darlmess and light!

Who the day ior toil hest given,
For rest the night3

May thine angel guarda defend uo,

Slumber sweet thy morey send us, “

Hory oreams and 'hopes attend us·
This livelong night.
