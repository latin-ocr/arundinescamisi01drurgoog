Ferewelh harewell, delusive dream!

The joy 01 youth, the poet's theme;

¹ Enchanting soenes 01 ιιιὶι11ι and glee,
When 011 was goy and all was free;
When infant loves first sparks were fanned,
Oemented friendships strictest bend,
And both together hore along
In union swect the power of song.

Enchsnting scenes‚ thet fancy loves, >

On which remembrenoe 011 shall dwell

With sad delight—deer soenes, harewell!
Even so, I've passed the fatal line,

And other suns ¹upon me shine:
But 0011ιο homesick sailor sees

Mid the waste waves his native trees;

And thinks the wide· stretched watery scene
Fair meadows cled ιιι vernel green.
So oft my fanoyt urns to view

These forms my livelier moments knew '

 

Thet friendships sacred voice approvcs3
