When (God known) I'm tonned nbout
nither with despair or doubt;
Yet before tho gloss runs out—

Sweot spirit, comfort me!

When the temptor me pursueth
With tho sins of nll my youth,

And hals damon me with their truth-
' Swoet Spin-it, oomfort me!

When the flames and hellinh crios
Fright my ears and ffight my eyes,
And all terrors me surpriso-
Swoet spirit, comfort me!

When the judgment is revealed,
And that open, whioh was saled,
When to thee I hove appenled—
Swoet spirit, comfort· me!
Hnnmon. ,

PSALM XIX.

Tan ¹spooioun firmament on high,

And all the blue etherinl sky,

The spangled heavens, a shining frome,
Their great original prooloim.
