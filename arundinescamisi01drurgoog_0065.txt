Snounn auld acquaintanoe be fnrgot,
And nevar brought ta min'3

Should auld acquaintance be forg0t‚
And days o' lang syna?

For auld lang ayne, my dear,

For auld lang syna,
We'll tak a cup 0' kindneas yet,
For auld lang ayne.

We twa hae run about the braes,
And pu't the gowans fine;

· But we've wandered many a weary 1001
Sin' auld lang ayne.

We twa hae paidl't in the burn
From morning sun till dine;

But suas between 118 braid hae roared
Sin' auld lang ayne.

And hare's a hand, my trusty fier,
Anu gua a hand 0⁴ tuna

Ι And we'll tux a right good willie waught,
'For auld lang ayne.

And surely ye'll be your 1111181001),
And surely I'll be mine;

And we'll tak a cup 0' kindness yet,
Fur auld lang syne. ’
