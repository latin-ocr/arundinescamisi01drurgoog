³ ΟΗ ΝΟ WE NEVER MENTION ΗΕΒ. ,

On 'not we never mention Her!
Her neme is never heard:

My lips are now forbid to speok
Thet once-familiar word.

'l'o banish my regret3

And when they win a smile nom me,
'l'hey think that Ι forget.

They bid me seek in change of soene
The choi-ms, that others see;

But, were I in a foreign land,
They'd find no change in me.

'Tio true, that Ι behold no more ι
The velley where we met3 =

Tho hnwthom·hee no more Ι oee—
But how ean Ι forgeti -

They tell me, she is bnppy nom n
The goyest‘ of the gay; Ι

They say, that she forgets me-but ⁴ ἶ
I heed not what they say3 .

Like me, perhaps she struggles with
Eoeh feeling of regnet:

But, if she loved ae Ι have loved‚
She never ean forget. ’
