EUPHELIA AND OHLOE.

Tne merchant, to secure his nesure,
Gonveys it in a borrowed neme:
Euphelia serves to grace my messum

Bub Ohloe is my real flame.

My subest verse, my darling lym,
Upon Euphelie's toilet lny3
When Chloe noted ber desire,
Theb Ι should sing, that Ι should play.v

Ι
Ι

My lyre Ι tune, my voiee Ι mise, ·
But with my numbers mix my eighs3
And whilst Ι sing Euphelia's prebe,
Ι fix my seul on Ohloe's eyes.

Fsir Ohloe -blushed—Eupbelia frowned:

Ι sung and gnned: Ι played and trembled:
And Venus to the loves eround

Remarked‚ how -ill we all dissembled.

Boon-n—nnn Baby, upon the tres-top;

When the wind blows the erndle will roek; Ι

Down wi-ll come cradle‚ beby, and all.
