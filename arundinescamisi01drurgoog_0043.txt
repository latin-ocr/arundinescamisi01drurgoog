OUPID AND OAMPASPE. ·

⁹(luem and my Oampaspe play'd

At cardes for kisses; cupid pay'd:

He stakes his quiver‚ bow and moves,

His mother's (lovea, and teame of spanows;

Loses them too; then down he throws

The corel of his lippe, the rose

Growing on's cheek (but none knows how);

With these the crystal of his browe,

And then the dimple of his chinne;

All these did my Oampaspe winne.

At last he set her both his eyes;

She won, and cupid blind did rise.

’ 0 Love! has she done this to thee?
What shall alas! beeome of mee?

ΑΒΙΕΠ, ADIEU! MY NATIVE SHORE. ⁵

“Amne adieu! my native shore
Fades 0'er the wetere blue3 -
The Night-winds sigh‚ the breakers roar,
And shrieks the wild searmeW.
Yon Sun that sets upon thesea
We follow in his flight3
Farewell awhile to him and thee,
My native Laud-Good Night!
