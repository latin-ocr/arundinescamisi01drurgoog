THE FlRST GRIEF.

ιΟιι ooli my brother book ho me,
I cannot play alone:

The summer oomee with flowor and boe—

Where is my brother gone?

The butterfly is gimoing bright
Along the sunheom's trook3
ἢ Ι oar-e not now to ohase ito ssight-
0 ooli my brother baok.

ἶ The flowers run wild—the flowers we sowed
Around our gurdon trem
Our vine is drooping with ito load—
0 eall him book ho me ,Ρ

'‘He would not heer my voice, fair ohild;
He moy not oome to thee: ¹

The feoe, that onoe like spring-timo smiled,
On earth ho more thou'lt see.-

Thy brother is in heaven? i
