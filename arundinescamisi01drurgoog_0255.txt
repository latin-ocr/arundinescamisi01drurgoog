GOOD FRIDAY.

Boowo upon the aooumed hee,

Foint ond blooding‚ who is He?

By the eyes so pale and dim,
Shoaming blood and writhing limb,
By tho flesh with soourges tom, Ι
By the orown of twisted thorn,

By thesides so deoply pieroed‚

By the baffied buming hirst,

By the drooping doehhewed hrow-'
Son of Man! 'tis Thou! 'tis Thou!

Bound upon the aooursed troo,

Dread and awful, who is He?

By the sun at noonday palo,

Shivoring rocks and rending veh, ⁰

By earth that trembles at his doom,
By yondor saints who burst oheh tomb,
By Edon, promised e'er He died,

To the selon by his sido,

Lord! our suppliont knees we how-
Son of God! 'tis Thou! ’tis Thou!
