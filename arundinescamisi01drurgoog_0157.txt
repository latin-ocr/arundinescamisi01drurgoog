‘Fly, fatal shaft‚' with cruel zeal
The conscious murtheress oded,
‘And towh yon haughty boy to feel
The anguish due to pride?

Το soothe the soul-subduing power
Awhile I fondly strom
But combated, alas! in vain,

The omnipotenoe of Loxsse.

'Then ah! at length, stem Power, forban, ἵ
Thy wrath at length foregO:
ι

Enough my youth hm felt of ουτος
Enough bas tasted woe.

Or if ordained by stubborn fate ¹
To drag the eternal chain,
Doomed‚ as Ι bend beneath its might,

To court relies in vain;

To Mira equa} toil impart3
On her thy pang best0w3

Thrill with Love's agony her beart,
And bid her suffer too.
