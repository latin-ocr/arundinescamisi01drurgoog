ΤΗΥ WILL ΒΕ DONE.

Μγ God, my Father, while Ι atray
Far from my home in life'a rough way, Ι Α
0 tamh me from my heart ιο say,

Thy will bodone!

Though dark my fate and sad my lot,

Lot me be still and mmmm not3.

But breathe the prayer divinely taught-
Thy will be done!

What though in lonely grief I sigh
For friends beloved, no longer nigh,
Ι ⁸ Submisaive Ι would still reply—
Thy will be done!

If thou shomd’st eall me to rasign
What most 1 prize, it ne'er was mine,
1 only yield thee what was thina-

Thy will be done!

If sickneas waatas me ιο ᾱοοογ,

Βοιωο with humbla saith obey,

And teach thy servant still to pray-
Thy will be done!

Renew my will from day ιο day,

Blend it' with thina, and take away

All that now malms it hard ιο say- ¹
Thy will be done!

Baaaauan.
