ΟΝ THE SPRlNG.

Lo! where the rosy-boeomed hours

Fuir Venus' trein appear,
Dicclose the long-expecting flowers

And wahe the purple year!
The attio warhler poure her throrw
Responsive to the cuckoo'e note,

The untaught harmony oi spring: '
While, whispering pleesure as they ily,
Gool Zephyre through the clear hlue sky

Their gethered ingruuce fling.

Where'er the oek'e thick branches stretch
A broeder hrowner ehode3

Where'er the rude and- mossprown beech
O'er-canopiee the glude3

Beside some weter's rushy hrink

. With me the Muse shall sit, end think

(At ease reclined in rustic stete)

How vain the ιιι-(101001 the crowd,

How low, how little are thc proud‚
How indigent the great!

Still is the toiling hand os Oore:
The penting herde repose:

Y‘et herlu, how through the peopled air
The busy murmur glows!
