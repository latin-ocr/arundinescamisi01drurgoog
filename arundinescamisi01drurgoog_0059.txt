lf any hopes thy bosom ohnre

. But those which Love has planted there,

Or any ceres but his'thy breont enthral,
Thou never yet his power hest known:
Love sito on a despotio throne,

And reigns a tyront, il he reigns ot nll.

Now if thou ont so lost a thing,
Hither thy tender sorrows bring,
And prove whose patience longest ean endure:
We'll strive whose fancy shall be tost
ln dreams of fondest passion most÷
For if thou thus host loved, oh never hope a oure! Ι
