ΤΟ MISTER LAWRENOE.

i annnnen, of virtuoim fathers virtuous son,

j now nat the ways are mn, and fiens an mire,
Ι Where shall we sometimes meet nnd by the fine
Help waste n sullen day, what may be won
From the hnrd seasnn gniningi Time will run

On smoother till Favonius reinspire

me nozen eam, ann nothe 'in fresh atine

The lily and rose that neither sowed nor spun.

What next repant shall feast us, light and choico,
κ Oi Attio teste with wine, whence we may riee
, no hen ne ine wei touched, οι mm voice
ἶ Wenble immortal notes of Tusean air.

He, who of these delight een judge and spere

Ι Το interpone them of, is not unwiee.
