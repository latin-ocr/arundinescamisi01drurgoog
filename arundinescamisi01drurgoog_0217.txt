PROGRESS OF ADVIOE. ἴ

Sine Riehnrd to Thomas-ond eeemed half afraid—

‘l'm thinking to marry my mistreee'e maid.

Now because Mre Luoy to thee is well known,

l'll do't if thou bid'st me or let it aione.

Now ‹lon't make a jeet on't; 'tis no jest to me,

In seith l'm in eamest, eo prithee be free.

κ 1 have no fault to find with the girl einoe l knew her,

But I'd heve thy advice e'er I tie myself to her.'
Saye Thomas to Richard-‘to epenk ¹my opinion,

There's not euoh abruto in king George'e dominium

And I finuly believe, if you knew her ιε’ l do,

Thou would'et ohooee out a whipping post first to be

tied to.

· She'e peevish, she'e thievish‚ ehe's ugly‚ ehe's old,

And o liar ond o fool and a slut and a eoold.'

¹ Next day Richard hastened to Church end was wed,

Audet night hed informed her eli Thomas had said.
