ARUNDINES GAMI·

BILLY TAILOR.

Brona Tertor was a brial( young fellow‚
Full of mirth and full of gloc,
Ι And his heart he did discover

To a maiden fair and free.

Four and twenty prese gang fellows‚
Dressed they was in blue array,

r Laid cruel hands on Billy Tailor:
Him they caught and sent to sea.

But his true love followed a'ter
By the name of Robert Uarr,
, Her lily-white hands were daubed all over
. With the nasty pitch and tar.

And in the very first engagement,
· Manfully ehe fought among the rest;
Till a bullet blew her jacket open,

And discovered her snow-white breaet:

Which when the Oaptain saw-‘ What equod, pray‚ ⁴
Hath blown yon hither, Manno-says he. ¹
{cfflmmfflme
Whom you pressed end sent to sea?
