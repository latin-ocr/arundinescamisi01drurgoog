ODE ΤΟ ADVERSITY.

Denennnn of Jove, relentless power,
J Thou tamer os the human brenet,
Ἴ Whoee iron seourge end torturing hour
ᾦ The bed affiight, nffliet the best!
Bound in thy adamantine chain,
The proud are taught to teste os pain,

And purple tyrants veinly grean Ι
With penge unfelt before, unpitied end alone.

Ν

When first thy Sire to send on earth
Ἴ Virtne, his derling child, designed,
γ To thee he gave the heavenly birth,
And bed to form her infant mind.
Stern rugged Nurse! thy rigid lore
, With patience many a year she bore;
What sorrow wne thou bnd'st her know, Ι
-, And from her own she learned to melt at others* woe. ·
