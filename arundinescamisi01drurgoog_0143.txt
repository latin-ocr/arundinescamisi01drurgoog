THE ISLES OF GREEOE.

Tun isles of (insece, the isles of Greeee,
Where buming Sappho loved end sung,
Where grew the urts of wer and peace,

where nuos rose anu Phoebus sprung! J
Etemnl summer gilde them yet, ’

Rutuli, except their sun, isset.

ι The mountains look on Manethon,
And Marathon looks on the sea3
And musing there en honr aione,
I dreamed that Greeoe might still be free:
' For standing on the Persien's greve,
1 could not deem myseli a slave,

A king sate on the roeky brow

Which looks o'er sea-born Salamis;
And ships by thousands lay below,
And meu in natione-ull were his!
He eounted them et break of day-
And when the sun set-where were they!
Bunou.
