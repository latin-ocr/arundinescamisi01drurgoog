Lightly they'll talk of the spirit thnt's gone,
And 0'er his eold ashes upbraid him;

But little he'll reeh, if they'll let him sleep on,
ln the greve where a Briton hm leid him.

But half os our drenry tnnk was done,
When the cloch told the hour ol retiring;

And we heard the distent and random gun,
'lhat the loe wne sullenly firing.

Slowly and mdly we lnid him down
From the field ol hie fame fresh and gory;
We carved not a line, we raised not a stone,

But we left him alone in his glory.

HEY MY (lHIOKEN.

Hnr my ehicken‚ my nhieken‚
And hey my chieken, my denryl
Such n sweet pet* as thi's
Was neither lar nor nenry.

Here we g'o up up up,
And here we go down down downy,

And here we go baelrwnrds and for-warde,
And here we gn round round roundy!
