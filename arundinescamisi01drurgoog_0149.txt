THE MAD DOG.
Goon people all of every sort

Give eor unto my eong;
And if you find it wondrouo short,

It cannot hold you long.

ln lelington there livedo mon

0f whom the world might say,
Thnt still o godly raee he ran,
Whene'er he went to prey.

A kind and gentle beart he hod

To comfort friends and foee;
The naked every day he elad,
When he put on his clothes.

And in that town a dog was found,
As many dogs there be,
Both mongreL puppy, whelp‚ and hound,

And oure os low degree.

The dog and manat first were friends;
But when a piqne began,

The dog to gain hie private ends ,
Went mod, end bit the man.
