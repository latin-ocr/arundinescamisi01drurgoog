And Tom ran orying down the street.

MY NATIVE VALE.

Dein ie my little native vale,

The n'ngdove builde end murmuro there,
Oloee to my eot she telle her tale

To every passing villingen
The squinel leeps 'from tree to hee,
And shells his nuto et liberty.

Through orange groves end myrtle howers
Thet hreethe a gale of lmgnnee round,
I oharm the leiry-footed hours
With the loved lnte's romantio sound;
Or erowns ol living lourel nonve,
For those that win the moe at eve.

nne signent nom n nen or ny,
The bellet dnnoed in twilight shede;
The cannonet and roundelay
Sung in the silent greenwood gladon
. These simple joys thet never fail
l Sholl bind me to my native vale.
