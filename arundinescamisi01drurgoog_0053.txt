THE PARENTS' WARNING.

Tnnnn children sliding nn the ice
All on a summer's day,

As it fell out, they all fell in,—
The rest they ran away.

Now had thesenhildren been at school,

Sliding upon dry ground,
Ten thousand ponnds to one penny
They had not all been drowned.

You parents that have children dean,
And eke you that have none,

If you will have them ense abroed,
Pray keep them ense nt home.

Gnnnnn Gunnon.
