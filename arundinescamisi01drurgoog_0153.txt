’ mon Bowm.
Ercn bower has beauty forme,
There's a eharm in each blossom that blows3
And, is absent the Lily should be, ’
Ι shall do very well with the Rese:
If Rosee are not in the way,
I'll fly to a Hyacinth soon3
And Ι never will quarrel with May,
For wanting the Roses of June.
No! no! 'tis my pleasure to ehase
Eaeh pretty bud under the sun:
Why should Ι insult the whole mee,
By a silly selection of one?

1 love each exotio, that deigns
In a elimate like this to expand;
And my heart its affection retains
For the bloom of my dear native land:
In summer's gay mansione Ι dwell,
And since summer so soon will be past,
’ Though Ι love her first bud very well,
Ι have love in reserve for her last.
³ Yes! yee! 'tis my pleasure to ehase
Eaeh pretty bud under the sun:

, Why should Ι offend the whole mee
By a silly seleet'ion of one? ⁸
Hermus err.
