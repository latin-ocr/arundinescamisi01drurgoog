³ PROGRESS OF POESY.
‘¹ Ture the voice, the danea obey‚
¹ Tempered to thy warhlod lay.
O'er Idalia'e velvet green ⁸
¹ The rosyorovned Lovee are seen,
' “ On Cytherea'e day, ν
With antio sporta and blue-eyed Pleoaurea
' Frieking h'ght in frolie measures;

r Now pursuing‚ now retreating,

*j Now in oiroling troops they meet:
, Το hrisk notas in oadenoe beehing¹ h

’ ῃ Glanee their many-twinkling feet.
Slov melting straim their Queen'a approach declaro: p
ᾖ Where'er she turns the Graoes homage pay: Χ
With anns sublime that float upon the air,
ξ In gliding state she wine her easy way:
h O'er her worm oheek arrd rising bosom move i*

The bloom of young Desire and purple light of hove. ἲ
