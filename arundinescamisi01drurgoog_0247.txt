PROPAGATION OF THE GOSPFL.

Fron Greenland's ioy mormius,
From India's oorol strand,

Where Afrio's sunny fountoins
Roll down their golden sond3

From many an ancient river,
From many a polmy plain,

They eall ue ho deliver

’ Their land from error's chain.

What though tho spioy broezos

The gifls
The heothen in hio blindness

Bows down to wood and stone.

Gan we, whose souls are lighted
With wisdom from on high,
Gan we to men benighted‚

The lamp of life deny?
Sahvahon! oh—Solvation!

The joyful sound proolaim;
Till each remotest nation
