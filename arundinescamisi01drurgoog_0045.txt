“A few short ho'urs and He will riso
Το give the morrow hirom

And Ι shall hml the main and ohies,
But not my mother earth.

Deserted io my own good hall,

wod weeds' are gothering on the woh
My dog howls at the goto. '

‘⁶ Oome himer, hithor‚ my little pago!
Why dost thoowoep and wohl?

Or dost thou dread the billow's' roge, ,
Or tremble at the gale?

out <mh oe marmop from ome &yffi
Our ship is swift ond strong:

0ur fleetost falcon soaroe oon fly -
More merrily along.”

‘Lot windo be shrilL let wavos roll high, ,
Ι sear not wave nor wind:

Yet mel not, sir omae, that 1
Am sorrowhhl in mind;

For Ι hove from my father gone,
A mother whom I love,

And hove no friend, save those alone,
But thee-and one above.
