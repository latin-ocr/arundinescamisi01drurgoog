ΡΙΤΤ.
· :Awn thou, bleet star ol Europe'e derkest hour, ,

Whoee words were wiedom, and whose oonneele power,
Whom earth applended through her peopled shores3

Alere! whom earth too early lost deplores:
Young without folliee, without rashnese bold,
And greatly poor emidet n nation's gold;
ln every veering gale ol fection true,
Untarnished Ohothnm's genuine child, adieu!
Unlike our common suns, whose gradual ray
Expende from twilight to intensor day,
l Thy bleze broke forth at once in lull meridien eway.
l 0 proved in danger! not the fieroest fleme
l Ol discord'e rege thy constant soul could teme;
ξ not when, far-striding wer ny posteo rand,

Ξ Gigantie treason took his holder stand3

ἶ Not when wild zenl, by murderous lection led,

ἰ On Wieldow'e hille her grase-green hemer spread;

Ξ Or those stern conquerors of the reetlees wave

l Defied the· native soil they wont te save.-

ξ nnouner panon n eat neaofn nour,

i When pride and genius own a etronger power3

ἐ When the dimmed eyeball and the struggling breeth‚

l And pnin end terror mark adveneing deeth;
