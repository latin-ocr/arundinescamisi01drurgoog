THE PALAOE OF IOE.

No forest fell

When thou would'st build; no qum-ry sent its stores
' n> emm thy wem but nou nm new the moes, .

And mehe thy merble of the ghsey wave.

In such e phinee Arietaeus found

Oyrene, when he bore the pleintive tale

thie lost bees to her matemnl ear:

In such a palene poetry might place

The nrmoury of winter, where his troom,

The gloomy clouds, find weapone, errowy sleeh

Skin-piereing volley‚ hlossom-bruising hail,

And snow that often blinds the traveller's course,

And wraps him in en unexpeeted tomb.

Silently ee a dream the fabric rose,

No soqnd of hammer or of saw was there,

Iee upon ite, the well-adjusted parts

Were soon conjoined‚ nor other cernent asked

Then water interfused to make them one.

hemps graeefully disposed and of all hues
Illumined every side; a watery light

Gleamed through the clear transpareney‚ that seemed i

Another moon new-risen, or meteor fallen
1 From heaven to earth, oi lambent fleme serene.
