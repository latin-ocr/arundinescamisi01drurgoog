THE LOTOS EATERS.

How sweet it were, hearing the downward stram,
With half-shut eyes ever to seem

Falling asleep in a halsdreem!

To dmm and aream, like yonder ambe light,
Which will not leave the myrrh bush on the height;
Το hear each other's whispered speech3

Eating the lotoe, day by day,

Το wateh the crisping ripples on the beaeh,

And vender eurving lines of ereamy spray:

Το lend our hem-ts and spirits wholly

’ To the influenoe os med-minded melancholy;

Το muse end brood and live again in memory‚
With the old faces of our infaney

Heaped over with a mound of grass,

Two handfuls os white dust shut in en urn os brass.

TO MARKET.

Το marhot, to market, to buy a plum bun;

’ χ Home again, home again, market is done.
