LOUISA.

Tnouerr by a sickly teste betrayed

Some may dispraiee the lovely maid,
With fearlese pride I say,

That she is healthful, fleet and strong,

And down the rocks ean leap along
Like rivulets in May.

And smiles hae she to earth unknown;
Smiles‚ that with motion os their own
Do spread and sink and riee;
That come and go with endlees play,
And ever as they pass away
Are hidden in her eyes.

She loves her ᾗτε, her cottagehome
Yet o'er the moorland will she roem
, ln weather rough and bleek3
And when against the wind she smine,
O might Ι kiss the mountain teins
That sparkle on her cheek.
