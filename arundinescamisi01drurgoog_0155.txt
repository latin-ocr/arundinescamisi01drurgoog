ΤΗΕ WISE ΜΕΝ OF GOTHAM.

'l'rrrrrrr wise men of Gothum
Went to see in e bork
And if the bowl had been stronger‚
My song hed been longer. ’

MIRA.

¹ wffl first the Siren Beauty's face
My wenderIng eye surveyed,
Unmoved 1 saw each freudful grece,
’ That round th' enehentress pleyed: ·

And still, with eerelees mierr elate,
Defied the Paphian's wile;

As ambushed in e look he sate,
Or couched beneath e smile.

And still to rove l madly vowed

ἵ Along the dangerous wey,
Seeure, where other boasters bowed
Before the tyrent's swey.

Nor learned my breast to heare the sigh‚
Or pour the secret heart3

Till Mire from her beemy eye Ι
Despetehed th' unerring dart. f
