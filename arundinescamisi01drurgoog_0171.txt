i Ost did the harvest to their sickle yolo,

ἶ Their furrow oft the stubhorn glebe hes hroke;
i How jocund did they drive their team efield!
How bowed the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!

γ Let not Ambition mooli their useful toil,
Their homely joys, and destiny obeoure; ,
Nor Grandeur hear with a disdeinful smile‚
The short and simple annals of the poor.

The boeot of hemfflry, the pomp of power, i
And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,
Await alike th' ineviteble hour: Ι
The pathe of glory lead but holthe grove. Ι

Nor you, ye prend, impute to these the fault,
If Memory o'er their tomb no'trophies raise,
Where thiough the long drawn aiele and fretted veuit,
The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.

Gen storied urn or animated bust
ἲ Baok to its mansion call the fleeting breathi
’ Gan Honour's voice provohe the silent dust,
ῑ Or Flattery soothe the dull eold ear of Deach
’ i
i Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid Ι
ξ Some heert once pregnant with celestia! fire; .
j flauo, that the roo of empire might have swayed, !
ἴ Or waked to ecetesy the living lyre. 3
