And kindling at delusione vain,
Believes and hopes them back again.
Then if Ι court their imaged charme,
My fevered soul is dp in arms;

And sickening nature proves at last

The passion weak‚ the moment past.

THE MAN OF THESSALY.

Tanna was a man of Thessaly,

And he was wondrous wise3
1 He jumped into a quickset hedge

And scratched out both his eyes:

And when he saw his eyes were out,
With all hi's might and main -

He jumped into another hedge-
And scratched them in again.
