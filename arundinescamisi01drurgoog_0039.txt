THE BLIND MAN'S BRIDE.

Wnnn first, beloved, in vanished hours,
The Blind Men eought thy hand 10 goin,
They said thy cheek was bright 00 flowers
New freshened by the summer's rein.
s '¹ The beauty which made them rejoice
’ My darhened eyes might never 000,
· Βο1 weh l knew thy gentle voice,
And 11ιο1 was all in all 10 me.

ὲ At length, as years rolled swiftly on,

¹ 'l'hey talhed to me 01 Time's decey,

i 01 10000 from thy 0011 cheek gone,
01 ebon tresses turned 10 grey.

l The withering change I could not see;

j Thy voice still choered my darkened lot,
And that was all in all to me.

And still, beloved, till life grows cold,
* ¹ ’ We'll wonder 'neoth the genial sky,
And only know that we are old
Ῐ By counling happy hours gone by.
i Ι Thy cheek may lose ite blushing hue,
Thy brow less beautiful may be; · ξ
