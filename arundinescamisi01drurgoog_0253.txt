ABUNDINES cnm.

Or thee perohnnoe a dnrker spell
Enthrnlls: the smooth stones of the flood,

By mountain gret or fell,
Pollute with infent's blood;

The ginnt altar on the roek,

The caver-n whence the timbrel's eall
Affiights the wandering floelr :—
'l'hou long'st to search them all.

Trust not the dengerous path agnin-
0 forwnrd step and lingering will!

0 loved and wnrned in vein!
And wilt thou perish still!

Thy message given, thine home in sight,
To the forbidden feast return!

Yield to the false delight

Thy better soul could epum?

Aras, my brother! round thy tomb
In sorrow kneeling, and in sear,

We read the Pastor's doom,
Who speaks and will not hear.

The gray hnired saint may fail at last,
The surest guide a wanderer prove;
Deeth only binds us fast

To the bright shore of love.
