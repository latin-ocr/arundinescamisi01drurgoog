SWEET EOHO.

Swrrr Echo, sweetest nymph, that livest unseen
Within thy aery shell,
By slow Meander's margent green, '
And in the violetembroidered vale, Ι
Where the love-loru nightingale Ι
Nightly to thee her sad song mourneth nell: Ι
Ornet thou not tell me of a gentle pair 1
That likest thy Narcissus aret·
O! ifthou hnve- ’ 1
Hid them .in some flowery cave,
Tell me but where, ,
Ι

Sweetqueen os penny, daughter of the sphere! !
So mny'st thou be translated to the skies‚

} And give resounding grase to nh heaven's harmonies.

Mrnron,

’ MARMION ΤΟ OLARE.

Ο nomn, in our hours of ease
Uncertain toy, and hard to plesse, ³ 1
And variable ss the shade n
By the light quivering aspen mnde3 ’ t
When pain and anguish wring the brow, Ι 1
Α ministering angel thou! ·
